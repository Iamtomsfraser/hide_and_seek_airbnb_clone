        <p>Yes, you can. You do not have to list your home exclusively on Hide n Seek. All we ask is that you synchronise your calendars with your other platforms. You do this just once when you join, and it ensures there are no double bookings or overlaps from your other platforms.</p>

        <p>We are there to help resolve your disputes personally and have a dedicated and hands-on customer service team who are there to protect both our hosts and our guests. As a host, you can set the security deposit for your property. Upon booking, our guests agree with our Terms of Service which state that they’re responsible for any damage. In the event of damage, all you need to do is notify Plum Guide and the guest within 48 hours of checkout. In appropriate cases we will then seek to charge the guest’s payment card. We will offer you our hands-on customer service team who are there to protect both our hosts and our guests.</p>
